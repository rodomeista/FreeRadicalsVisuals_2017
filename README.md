# Visualizer Experiments
## Audio visualizer experiments created with THREE.js and Web Audio API

### Summary
Drag and drop a song from your computer and visualize the tunes. Visualizations are created by analyzing the waveform and frequency data through the Web Audio API and then rendered in canvas with THREE.js. In this version there is a navigation bar that allows you to experiment with some of the older visualizers I made (sqaure, sphere, waveform, and lines). Within the spiral page there are four different visualizers all based on the Archimedean Spiral that can be toggled seamlessly while playing a song, as well as three different color schemes.
  
Play around!! It's mind blowing how visually different songs can be.
